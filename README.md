dreaming Co-Woking Place.
CoWoFi is an application that helps managers, executives and the general public who need to rent an ideal space for their work team.

Not only for rent, if you have a beautiful workspace that you understand can be enjoyed by others, you can publish it and earn extra money. The best is always to share
